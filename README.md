# mumflow
A nextflow pipeline to run the mummer pipelines (align genomes, call snps) and process outputs into sane formats.

Mumflow pairwise aligns a number of assembled genomes to a set of reference genomes, and outputs common
results for presence absence variant (PAV), snp, and repeat finding in standard formats.

More documentation to come.
